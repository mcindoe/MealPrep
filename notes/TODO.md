# TODO

- [ ] Regex for email addresses, and verify all email addresses on config load

- [ ] HEALTHY meal tag and rule

- [ ] Utility to display programmed meals, and ingredients to console / file
	- Display tags on the meals, check for spelling mistakes etc, check that ingredients are in appropriate categories

- [ ] Test that any requirements.txt are required. This project runs with vanilla python right?
	- Check on the home machine. I think I just need neovim installed for my purposes. Perhaps a python linter as well, but this shouldn't be part of the project setup configuration

- [ ] Check for any TODOs in the source code and move them here

- [ ] Bug: uncaught duplicate ingredient entries in a meal. Test and fix. Unit tests required.
