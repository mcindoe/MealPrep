- [ ] Main Courses
	- [ ] Lebanese chicken with Tahdig

- [ ] Add a helper script which displays just what is and is not in the main meal configuration
- [ ] The current setup I have on maximising the forward choice causes some issues with the first meal. Maybe I should just randomly choose from the available choices. If I have a sufficiently high number of meals, then this won't be an issue. I'm just worried about running out of meals, but that could not be an issue. It won't be for our use case - we will have quite a large universe
